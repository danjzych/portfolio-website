					<p>
						In a past life, I was a Product Manager that built a
						data-driven SaaS product from the ground up (as well as touring
						musician and record producer).
					</p>
					<p>
						Though I’ve moved on from product and design, I’m still product
						and design-minded, and love building applications with clean,
						snappy front-ends that are intuitive and enjoyable for the end
						user. I love any opportunity to apply both my analytical and
						creative sides to technical projects, and bring a unique blend
						of both to everything I work on.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I’m not hunkered down at my computer, I’m making music 🎸,
						skateboarding 🛹, hanging out with my girlfriend and our cats
						🐈, or having one more coffee than I need to, then regretting
						it ☕️.
