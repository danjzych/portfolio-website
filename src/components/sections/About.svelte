		<p>
			In a past life, I was a Product Manager that built a data-driven SaaS
			product from the ground up (as well as touring musician and record
			producer). Though, I’ve moved on from product and design, I’m still
			product and design-minded, and love building applications with clean,
			snappy front-ends that are intuitive and enjoyable for the end user.
		</p>
		<p>
			I love any opportunity to apply both my analytical and creative sides
			to technical projects, and bring a unique blend of both to everything
			I work on. I’m currently searching for my next opportunity, and would
			love to bring my skills to you and your team.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I’m not at my computer, I’m skateboarding, hanging out with my
			girlfriend and our cats, or having one more coffee than I need to,
			then regretting it.
